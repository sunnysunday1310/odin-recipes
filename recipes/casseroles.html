    <p>A perfect homestyle Breakfast Casserole recipe! 
        Filled with the works – including hash browns, eggs, ham, 
        two kinds of cheese and fresh herbs. 
        Then of course there’s some butter and half and half 
        included to make it a richer breakfast worthy of holidays, 
        celebrations and weekends!
        <p>
            <ul>
                <b>Ingredients</b>
             <li>  Refrigerated hash browns – these are sometimes found by the dairy 
                at grocery stores and at other places I’ve even 
                found them in the meat section.
                 Ask a clerk if you have trouble locating them.</li>
               <li>Butter – salted or unsalted butter works fine here. 
                This is used to saute the hash browns, which 
                adds more flavor and helps soften them a little 
                since they start out as crisp raw potatoes.</li>
               <li> Half and half – wondering what half and half even is? 
                It’s basically a blend of half milk and half cream 
                so if needed just use 3/4 cup milk 3/4 cup cream.</li>
                <li>Cheddar cheese – for bolder flavor go for sharp cheddar.</li>
                <li>Swiss cheese – you can also switch up the cheeses 
                    listed with others you may have.
                </li>
                <li>Cooked ham – this recipe is a great way to use up 
                    leftover ham if you have some from a roast ham. 
                    Otherwise you can use pre-diced package ham or a ham 
                    steak and dice that up.</li>
                    <li>Green onions – for a stronger onion flavor feel 
                        free to double up the amount listed.</li>
                        <li>Fresh parsley – parsley is one of those things that 
                            I love to add for color. It doesn’t 
                            add a ton of flavor but it always 
                            makes a dish look prettier.
                        </li>
              </ul>
        
    <h2>How to Make Breakfast Casserole:</h2>
              <ol>

    over medium high heat. Spread hash browns into 
    an even layer in pan. Let cook until golden brown on bottom about 6 – 8
     minutes, then turn potatoes and continue to cook 3 minutes longer.</li>. 
<li> Spread potatoes into dish: Pour hash 
    browns into prepared baking dish, set aside.</li>

    and break yolks and stir together with a fork until blended.

    brown layer in baking dish then spread out with 
    a spatula to even out top as needed.</li>

    is just set, about 40 – 50 minutes. Let cool about 5
     minutes before slicing and serving.</li>
<li>To cook the baked ziti: Tent baking dish with foil 
    (don't let it touch the cheese or it will stick) and 
    bake 15 minutes then uncover and bake 10 - 15 minutes longer until cheese is 
    melted throughout. Serve warm.</li>
